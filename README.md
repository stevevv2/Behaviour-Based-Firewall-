# Behaviour-Based-Firewall
Behaviour-Based firewall Using Machine Learning and SDN in Networks
The project incooporates Machine Learning and SDN to design a Behaviour-Based firewall that will detect and log any unusual activity to the user dashboard.
feel free to execute the code and any suggestions to future works will be truly appreciated
# Future works
The project creates a few possibilities of improvement and studies:
 Typing: Perform real-time parsing of PCAP by embedding live packet sniffing and feature
extraction PCAP embed DIYs using Scapy or PyShark.
 Self- healer networks: Reconfigure or reroute switching through automation based on
reoccurring anomalies.
 Distributed SDN security: Scale the model to the multi-controller, ONOS or Open Daylight,
SDN architecture.
